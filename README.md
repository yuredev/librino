## About

<p>Currently, Brazil has several difficulties with regard to the inclusion of deaf people in society. Among which it is possible to mention the scarcity of professionals with knowledge in the Brazilian Sign Language (Libras), a means of communication aimed at the deaf and legally recognized in the country.</p>

<p>Learning Libras for people with no contact with qualified professionals and who did not learn Libras at school is most often an arduous task, which means that students who intend to improve their skills, have learning difficulties, which includes both deaf and hearing individuals. This adds to the fact that there are few technological tools that help in the learning process in a self-taught way.</p>

<p>Otherwise it is possible to mention the wide range of technological solutions of the most varied types catered to the teaching of spoken languages that bring great gains in the learning process. Therefore, it is possible that when using similar strategies, but addressed to the teaching of Libras, benefits will be brought to the deaf community, in addition to promoting the integration of the deaf into society.</p>

<p>In this way, taking inspiration from existing spoken language applications, an application for Android mobile devices was developed, with playful didactics and game approaches aimed at increasing the number of technological tools aimed at teaching Libras and facilitating its learning process. The developed application is a platform where people who feel able to teach Libras can create classes and insert contents such as learning modules, lessons and questions, so that students can consume them and resolve questions in the form of a quiz game.</p>

<p>Over time, the student can complete lessons in the application and content creators can follow their students' learning, visualizing the progress of each one of them in their created content.</p>
